## Description

There is some modification of the HTML and CSS files, but mainly a Javascript file was created with the objective to build the app's functionality from a static project to an interactive one while maintaining responsiveness accross devices.

## Usage

The objective of the Landing Page project is to add functionality to a static webpage: add a navigation bar with pointers that
highlight sectional links upon hovering, that smoothly scroll into sections of the webpage upon clicking, and enable events over a section to activate its css styling on that particular active section. 

Furthermore, placing additional sections to the webpage dynamically extends the functionality of the website features described above.

## Dependencies

Udacity provided some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project.
